  <h1>PARAKEET</h1>

  <h4>Definitions </h4>
  

    <ul>
      
        <h5> <li> <em>
        Any of numerous small usually brightly coloured long-tailed parrots, 
        such as Psittacula krameri ( ring-necked parakeet), of Africa. </em> </li> </h5>

       <h5> <li> <em> 
        Often kept as pets and noted for the ability
        to mimic speech: several species are endangered.</em> </li> </h5>

        <h5> <li> <em> 
        Although they can be fed seeds and variations of birdseed, 
        a diet of seeds alone could cause a parrot more harm than good. </em> </li> </h5>
